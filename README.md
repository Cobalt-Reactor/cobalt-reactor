# cobalt_reactor

[**Cobalt Reactor**](https://www.cobaltreactor.com) is the software company owned by [**Rantz**](https://www.github.com/bobg1983).

This mono-repo contains the various utility crates and tools used by Cobalt Reactor for game development using [Bevy](https://www.bevyengine.org).

To build the exes the plan is to use cross. If you're building on Windows you'll need to install and setup cross and docker. See the [Cross - Getting Started](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) guide.

TODO: Install cross and create cross build scripts
